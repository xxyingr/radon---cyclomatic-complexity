1> fistly, I tried cloud_haskell and there is a problem of ghc version with argon; 

2> I sent emails to ask help, but mo replies; 

3> I turned to python flask.

Until now, I have learned how to implement with python using flask. However, when running the code, there is failure to connect manager with worker. 

run:

python3 manager.py; input the number of workers needed, manager will run in localhost

python3 worker.py

ideally, works will connect to manager and get commits to compute complexity, but I still did not solve the problem of connection.
